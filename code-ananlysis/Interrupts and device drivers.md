### Paket Reception
packet reception consists of :
* recognizing the presence of a packet on the wire
* performing address filtering
    * whether bad packets should be received 
* storing the packet in the receive data FIFO
    * Memory buffers pointed to by descriptors store packet data
*  transferring the data to a receive buffer in host memory
*  updating the state of a receive descriptor
